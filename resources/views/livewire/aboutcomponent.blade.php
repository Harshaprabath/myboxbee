                                <p>We started BOXFOX in 2014 with a clear mission: to bring gifting into the 21st
                                    century—creating stronger relationships through personal gifts, powered by the
                                    simplest user experiences.<br><br> After college, a close friend got sick and we
                                    realized the lack of options for being “there” for her when we couldn't be
                                    physically. We wanted something that went beyond flowers and the typical overpriced
                                    (and wasteful) gift basket. Our standards were high: we wanted something
                                    presentable, personal, and with purposeful product that was simple to send. As we
                                    explored this need, we discovered that others wanted a modern and seamless gifting
                                    experience, too. <br><b>It didn't exist, so we built it.</b> <br><br> Almost 7 years
                                    later, our e-commerce site lets customers either pick a thematic, expertly curated
                                    option or build the perfect gift box for any occasion through our proprietary BUILD
                                    A BOXFOX platform. Whether personal or corporate, we top each gift with a
                                    handwritten note and ship around the world.<br><br> While modern technology powers
                                    our business, it’s also why our world needs companies like ours. <br><br> Our
                                    approach to business is centered around honoring and maintaining our most important
                                    relationships in a tangible way. We’re committed to making elevated gifting an
                                    accessible, affordable, and everyday option for our loyal customers and building a
                                    business our employees are proud and happy to come to everyday. <br><br></p>
